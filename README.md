# linux_handover-demo
WIFI and BT handover demo application based on Linux libnfc-nci stack

This application shows how to use Linux libnfc-nci stack to write to tag, or share with Peer device, NFC Forum NDEF message containing WIFI or BT credentials according to current standards (WIFI alliance and NFC Forum Connection Handover).

For WIFI, pay attention that parameters have to be consistents (for instance in case of AES encryption the password must be at least 8 characters long).
